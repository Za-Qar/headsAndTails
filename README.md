# Head and Tails (playable in the console)

This game was written in JavaScript using object oriented programming but was just for practice and can be played however only in your browser's alert box and console. Pretty straight forward, you play against the code I we wrote and can choose either heads or tails. 
If you would like to play, refresh the page once it loads then right click (ctrl click if on IOS) and inspect element. Then you can type in "heads" or "tails" in the alert box and view your score against the browser in the console [View project](https://heads-and-tails.netlify.app).
